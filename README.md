# LearnCoin

## COM S 402C Project: Group 8

LearnCoin is a cryptocurrency that is not intended to be particularly efficient or any more secure than other cryptocurrencies, but rather strives to have a very readable codebase and still implements the necessary mechanisms for the network to be non-trivially secure with protection against common attacks. It is intended to be used as a learning resource for anyone who wants to understand cryptocurrencies better, or for anyone interesting in developing cryptocurrencies of their own.

The project also includes a wallet client that provides basic key generation and transaction functionality while also explaining the blockchain and transaction mechanisms.
