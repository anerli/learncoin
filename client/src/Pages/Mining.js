            <br/>
            <h2>So you'd like to mine LearnCoinâ€¦ Here's how you get started.</h2>
            <p className='mining'>
                This page will guide you through the process of setting up a LearnCoin server node. This is somewhat technical, so some experience
                with Python and your operating system's shell is recommended but not required.<br/><br/>

                Note: Setting up a server is not necessary to start a LearnCoin wallet and make transactions! To do that, just click <a href='/login'>here</a>! <br/>
                Note: If you would like to understand more about what mining actually means, please see the <a href='/learning'>Crypto 101</a> page! <br/>
            </p>
            <h2>Requirements</h2>
            <p className='mining'>
              - Python 3.6 or above. You can download Python <a target="blank" href="https://www.python.org/">here</a>. For the remainder of this guide, we assume Python is installed and on your PATH. <br/>
              - Pip, Python's package manager. This comes installed with Python. <br/>
              - Git, the version manager. More information regarding how to install git can be found <a target="blank" href="https://git-scm.com/">here</a>.
            </p>

            <h2>Setup</h2>
            <p className='mining'>

                First, you will need to clone the LearnCoin codebase which can be found <a target="blank" href='https://git.ece.iastate.edu/lie/learncoin'>here</a>.<br/>
                
                Command:<br/> 
                &emsp; `git clone https://git.ece.iastate.edu/lie/learncoin.git`

                <br/><br/>

                In the `server` directory, the `server.py` files is the main entry point for running the LearnCoin server.<br/>
                However, first you need to make sure all Python dependencies are installed:<br/>
                Command (assuming you are in the server directory):<br/>
                &emsp; `pip install -r requirements.txt`<br/><br/>

                Now you can run the server script simply with:<br/>
                &emsp; `python server.py`<br/>
                (assuming `python` is the command for your Python 3 installation).<br/><br/>

                You should see the server boot up, and you will get a few server logs.<br/>
                However, there are several arguments that can be passed for extended functionality.<br/>
                The most important of which might be the `-n` argument, which allows you to pass a neighbor node URL, so that you can connect
                to an existing network.<br/><br/>
                LearnCoin servers are hosted at `coms-402-sd-23.class.las.iastate.edu` and run on port 80, so to start a server and connected to this network, use the command:<br/>
                &emsp; `python server.py -n coms-402-sd-23.class.las.iastate.edu:80`<br/><br/>

                Additionally `--mine` is an argument that tells your LearnCoin server to start mining, as opposed to just receiving and verifying transactions. 
                So if you actually want to mine, make sure to pass this argument! <br/><br/>

                The argument `-k [key]` will allow you to enter a specific private key instead of generating a new one for you. That way you can use
                an existing private key from the wallet interface to have your rewards sent to!<br/><br/>

                Use `python server.py -h` to get additional information on other arguments.<br/><br/>

                Happy mining!

                After the learn coin codebase is set up, you will need to navigate to the learncoin/server directory in your terminal: <br/>
                &emsp; 1) Find where you saved the codebase in your file explorer. <br/>
                &emsp; 2) Right click on the folder and choose 'Open in terminal'. <br/>
                &emsp; 3) Type 'cd server' to enter the server folder.
                <br/>
                From here, you should be able to see a file called server.py (type 'ls' to see everything inside the current folder).
                <br/><br/>
                Type 'Python3 server.py --neighbors coms-402-sd-23.class.las.iastate.edu --mine' to start mining!
                <br/><br/>
                'Python3 server.py' starts the LearnCoin server. <br/>
                '--neighors coms-402-sd-23.class.las.iastate.edu' is a tag that connects your computer to the LearnCoin network through one of the University servers that is constantly running LearnCoin.
                If this does not work, try one of the other servers by changing 23 to any other number from 23-27. <br/>
                '--mine' is a tag that tells your LearnCoin server to start mining. <br/>
                '--k' will allow you to enter a specific private key instead of generating a new one for you. */}
